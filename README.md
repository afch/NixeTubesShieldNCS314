Sketch for Arduino UNO and Nixie Tubes Shield NCS314 by GRA &amp; AFCH
1. This repository content sources of project for Nixie Clock developed by GRA & AFCH.

	Folders description:
  
	FIRMWARES - source code that must be complied in Arduino IDE, and allready compiled Binary files in *.hex format ready to be uploaded on to property board by flasher.
  
	GRA & AFCH Compiled Firmware Flasher - flasher (uploader) that must be used in prevois step.
  
	LIBRARIES - Arduino libraries without which compiling will be failed. That folders must be copied to Arduino LIBRARIES folder, (default path: C:\Users\USER_NAME\Documents\Arduino\libraries)
  
	SCHEMES - electrical shemes for boards: for Nixie Clock Main Units - MCU, and for Nixie Tubes Boards
  
	USB DRIVERS - drivers for USB-to-SERIAL(UART) converters
  
	USER MANUAL - end user's manuals.
